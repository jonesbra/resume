        Hello, my name is Brandon Jones and I am a Senior at the University of Kentucky.
        I study Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
      </strong></p>

      <p>
        Since May of 2016, I have been employed at <a href="https://www2.wwt.com/">World Wide Technology</a> where I have gained
        a great amount of engineering experience as an <strong>Automation Engineer</strong>. The bulk of my engineering experience
        lies in programming, specifically <strong>application development</strong> and <strong>configuration management</strong>
        of IT equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
	Though my interest lies in multiple fields of engineering, I've recently decided to focus on <strong>applying my knowledge to the field of Biomechanics.</strong>
        I would also like to apply my experience in programming to this field.
