        Hello, my name is Brandon Jones and I am a Senior at the <strong>University of Kentucky.</strong>
        I study <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Computer Science.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Since May of 2016, I have been employed at <a href="https://www2.wwt.com/">World Wide Technology</a> where I have gained
        a great amount of engineering experience as an <strong>Automation Engineer</strong>. The bulk of my engineering experience
        lies in programming, specifically <strong>application development</strong> and <strong>configuration management</strong>
        of IT equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
	      My goal for the near future is to advance my career as a DevOps Engineer. I have gained significant experience in many
        of the toolsets that serve as the foundation for this career path, including: <strong>Ansible, Jenkins, Sys Admin, Python, JS.</strong>
      </p>
